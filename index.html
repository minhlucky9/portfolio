                <p>Like many young people, video games have been associated with my entire childhood. I have been exposed to these games since high school, from simple games on the black and white phone like Snake to the PC games with higher graphics like League of Legends or Genshin Impact.</p>
                <p>For me, video games are not just entertaining games, it's also a whole new world where I can explore, discover, and create memorable memories with my close friends. Gradually, video games have become my passion, and I want to create many interesting and captivating games with my own hands. That's why I have chosen "Virtual Reality" as my field of study and research today and in the future.</p>
                <p>At the moment, I have participated in several game and simulation projects developed using Unity3D, HTML and ThreeJS.</p>
